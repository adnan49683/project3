Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course

Welcome to my submission for the final project of the course! Please make sure that the .R file is inside the same directory as the Samsung data provided in the course.

The code of the project involves four parts: retrieving the data, transforming the data, grouping/calculating the means, writing to file.

The main output of this script is the final dataset and the tidy dataset (latter also saved as txt!).

Let me know if there are anything I have to rewrite.
